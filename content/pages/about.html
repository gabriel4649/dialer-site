                                Koipun is more than just about learning Japanese. It is also
                                about helping people realize their full potential, give them access
                                to new worlds, learn self-discipline, make new friends and
                                last but not least have fun! Finally, we believe that by getting to
                                know other cultures we learn more about ourselves and become
                                more tolerant, loving and understanding.

                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        こんにちは、みなさん。 私は<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gabriel-j-perez-irizarry/86/b85/574/">
                        ガブリエル</a>です。 I started Koipun right after
                        graduating in 2014 from Georgia Tech where I earned a Master's degree in
                        Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have had a life long passion for Japanese
                        culture. Because of that I have tried to learn Japanese many times, but
                        had always failed, until I started taking Japanese at Georgia
                        Tech, where I became enamored with the class and started making
                        progress very fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After taking <a href="http://www.modlangs.gatech.edu/courses/online-courses?destination=node/1609">
                        Professor Masato Kikuchi's online version of the class</a> I got the
                        idea of making this accessible to all Japanese learners around
                        the globe, and here we are now!
